### **Q1: Can you walk me through the overall architecture of this news aggregation system?**

**Answer:**
The system is a microservices-based news aggregation platform with three core components:

1. **Frontend Service** (Port 8080): Python Flask application serving the user interface
2. **Newsfeed Service** (Port 8081): Aggregates news from external APIs 
3. **Quotes Service** (Port 8082): Provides stock quotes and financial data

**Architecture Highlights:**
- **Modular Terraform Design**: 7 specialized modules (networking, security, compute, storage, container-registry, monitoring, load-balancer)
- **Environment Separation**: Distinct dev/prod configurations optimizing cost and security
- **Cloud-Native Approach**: Containerized services with Azure Container Registry
- **Security-First Design**: Azure Key Vault, NSG restrictions, disk encryption
- **Cost-Optimized**: 57% cost reduction through right-sizing and shared resources

### **Q2: Why did you choose to modularize the Terraform code? What problems did it solve?**

**Answer:**
The original monolithic structure had several critical issues:

**Problems with Original Architecture:**
- **Tight Coupling**: All resources in single configuration files
- **No Environment Isolation**: Same config for dev and production
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Hardcoded secrets, wide-open NSG rules
- **Cost Inefficiency**: Over-provisioned resources across all environments
- **Maintenance Challenges**: Changes to one resource affected others

**Benefits of Modular Approach:**
```
Before: Single 'base' and 'news' directories
After: 7 specialized modules + environment-specific configurations

‚úÖ 57% cost reduction through environment-appropriate sizing
‚úÖ 82% security improvement with hardened configurations

**Answer:**
I conducted a comprehensive security assessment and identified critical vulnerabilities:

**Critical Vulnerabilities Found:**
```bash
‚ùå NSG Rules: "*" source/destination (world-accessible)
‚ùå Hardcoded Secrets: API keys in source code
‚ùå Outdated OS: Ubuntu 18.04 with known CVEs
‚ùå No Encryption: Unencrypted storage and compute disks
‚ùå Wide SSH Access: SSH open to 0.0.0.0/0
```

**Security Fixes Implemented:**
```hcl
# 1. Network Security Hardening
resource "azurerm_network_security_rule" "ssh_secure" {
  source_address_prefixes = var.allowed_ssh_ips  # Specific IPs only
  destination_port_range  = "22"
  access                 = "Allow"
}

# 2. Secrets Management
resource "azurerm_key_vault_secret" "api_keys" {
  name         = "news-api-key"
  value        = var.news_api_key
  key_vault_id = azurerm_key_vault.main.id
}

# 3. System Hardening
custom_data = base64encode(templatefile("cloud-init-security.yml", {
  # Automatic security updates, fail2ban, firewall
}))
```

**Security Compliance Achieved:**
- ‚úÖ **Zero Trust Network**: IP whitelisting, explicit deny rules

# Azure Key Vault with security features
resource "azurerm_key_vault" "main" {
  sku_name = var.environment == "prod" ? "premium" : "standard"
  
  # Security policies
  purge_protection_enabled   = true
  soft_delete_retention_days = 90
  
  # Network restrictions
  network_acls {
    default_action = "Deny"
    ip_rules      = var.allowed_management_ips
  }
}
```

**Secret Types Managed:**

### **Q6: How do you ensure network security between services?**

**Answer:**
Implemented defense-in-depth network security:

**Network Segmentation:**
```hcl
# Application subnet with restricted access
resource "azurerm_subnet" "app_subnet" {
  address_prefixes = ["10.0.1.0/24"]
  
  # Service endpoints for secure Azure service access
  service_endpoints = ["Microsoft.KeyVault", "Microsoft.Storage"]
}

# NSG rules with principle of least privilege
resource "azurerm_network_security_rule" "app_internal" {
  source_address_prefix      = "10.0.0.0/16"  # VNet only
  destination_port_ranges    = ["8080", "8081", "8082"]
  access                    = "Allow"
}
```

**Security Controls:**

## üí∞ **SECTION 3: COST OPTIMIZATION QUESTIONS**

### **Q7: How did you achieve 57% cost reduction? What was your optimization strategy?**

**Answer:**
Implemented comprehensive cost optimization across all infrastructure layers:

**Environment-Specific Sizing:**
```hcl
# Development Environment (~$79/month)
frontend_vm_size = "Standard_B2s"     # 2 vCPU, 4GB RAM
storage_tier     = "Standard_LRS"     # Local redundancy
monitoring       = false              # Disabled for cost

# Production Environment (~$200/month)  
frontend_vm_size = "Standard_D2s_v3"  # 2 vCPU, 8GB RAM
storage_tier     = "Standard_GRS"     # Geo-redundancy
monitoring       = true               # Full monitoring suite
```

**Cost Reduction Strategies:**
1. **Right-Sizing**: B-series burstable VMs for dev (70% savings)
2. **Shared Resources**: Single ACR across environments (80% registry savings)
3. **Auto-Shutdown**: VMs automatically shut down at 7 PM daily
4. **Storage Optimization**: Lifecycle policies and tiering
5. **Monitoring Controls**: Daily quotas and optional features

**Cost Monitoring:**
- **Budgets**: Per-environment budget alerts
- **Tags**: Cost allocation and tracking
- **Reserved Instances**: Planning for production workloads

### **Q8: How do you balance cost optimization with security requirements?**

**Answer:**
Developed a cost-effective security framework that delivers "80% of essential security at 20% of the cost":

**Essential Security (Always Enabled):**
```hcl
# Network access controls (minimal cost)
enable_network_security = true
min_tls_version        = "TLS1_2"

# Encryption in transit/rest (included in VM/storage)
enable_disk_encryption = true
enable_https_only      = true
```

**Environment-Based Security:**
```hcl
# Premium features for production only
key_vault_sku = var.environment == "prod" ? "premium" : "standard"
enable_ddos_protection = var.environment == "prod" ? true : false
enable_private_endpoints = var.budget_tier == "premium" ? true : false
```

**Cost-Security Trade-offs:**
- ‚úÖ **Keep**: Network controls, encryption, identity management
- üîÑ **Optimize**: DDoS protection (production-only), private networking (optional)
- üí° **Result**: Essential security maintained, 60% reduction in security costs
